You'll find relevant scripts to take a Keras HDF5 model, extract the weights, convert it to a Tensorflow protobuf weight format (`get_weights.py`), and quantize the protobuf representation to an 8-bit weights network (`quantize.sh`). You'll need to have compiled Tensorflow's 8-bit operations tools from [source](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/quantization), and this requires Bazel. Feel free to reach out with questions.
